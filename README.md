# Hydration Reminder App

The Hydration Reminder App is an Android application designed to help users maintain proper hydration throughout the day by sending regular reminders to drink water.

## Features

- *Reminder Schedule*: The app sends reminders every two hours from 8 AM to 8 PM, encouraging users to drink water regularly. I can be customized on adding one more feature of customization for genral purposes also.
- *User Interaction*: Users can start or stop the hydration reminders through a simple and intuitive interface, providing flexibility based on their daily needs and activities.
- *Notification System*: The app utilizes Android's built-in notification system to alert users at the specified times, with each notification reminding them to drink a glass of water.
- *Local Data Storage*: User settings, such as whether the reminder is active or not, are saved locally on the device, ensuring that the app remembers the user's preferences even after being closed or the device being restarted.
